I have found a way to solve Maxwell’s equations in open space analytically.

Solving Maxwell’s equations analytically is like discovering an entrance to a treasure cave. The more I dig in the cave, the more treasures I see there are to be dug out.<br>
I am facing math difficulties, and lacking high performance computing resources. It is beyond a retired engineer’s hobby. I want to share the treasure cave to anyone who is interested in exploring it.<br>
What I got so far are presented in the following reports.

1. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/TimeSpaceTheorem.pdf">Time Space Theorem From Maxwell’s Equations</a>  <br>
Date: August 14, 2023<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Maxwell’s equations give a relation between the first order curls and the first order temporal derivatives. This paper proves that such a relationship exists for any orders, not just for the first order. Formulas for such relationships are presented and proved.

2. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/SolvingMaxwellEqs.pdf">Solving Maxwell’s Equations in Open Space</a><br>
Date: August 15, 2023<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: A generic analytical solution to Maxwell’s equations in open space is deduced, which is expressed in initial field values and field sources. The generic solution is in summations of series. From the summations of series, closed form analytical solutions are obtained for given initial values and field sources. Several typical examples of 3D closed form analytical solutions are obtained in this approach.

3. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/hyperExpFunc.pdf">A Closed Form Analytical Solution to Maxwell’s Equations in Response to a Time Invariant Gaussian Source</a><br>
Date: August 22, 2023<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: A closed form analytical solution to Maxwell’s equations in response to a time-invariant Gaussian source is deduced. A new family of functions appears in the solution. Functions in the new family are formed by inseparable or separable hyperbolic-exponential elements. A naming convention for the new functions is proposed. Characteristics of the new functions are studied. Graphics of the new functions and the electromagnetic fields are presented.

4. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/speedGauss1D.pdf">Speeds of Electromagnetic Fields of a Gaussian Source</a><br>
Date: September 2, 2023<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Based on the closed form analytical solution to Maxwell’s equations in response to a Gaussian source, formulas for the propagation speeds of the electric field and the magnetic field are derived. The formulas tell us that for this source the propagation speeds rise quickly from 0 to the standard light speed c, but never reach c. Therefore, when we measure the field speeds, without extremely high precision instruments we will get a constant speed of c. High precision calculations are made based on those formulas to study the characteristics of the propagation speeds.

5. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/MovingSource.pdf">1D Solution to Maxwell’s Equations in Response to a Moving Source</a><br>
Date: September 23, 2023<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: A generic solution to Maxwell’s equations in response to a constant speed moving source is deduced and verified. The solution is for 1D fields in open space. Two examples are given. One example is a time-invariant Gaussian source. The other example is a trigonometric source with Gaussian decay. The results are used to examine the Michelson-Morley experiment. Electromagnetic fields are calculated using the solutions to Maxwell’s equations in response to a cosine source. The calculation results show significant differences between applying coordinate transformation to a stationary source solution and to a moving source solution, leading to a question whether non-null results of Michelson-Morley experiment should be expected.

6. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/speedMoveGauss1D.pdf">Electrodynamics of a Moving Gaussian Source</a><br>
Date: May 24, 2024<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Based on closed form analytical solutions to Maxwell’s equations for a moving Gaussian source, the dynamics of electromagnetic fields are investigated via large amounts of precise numeric calculations and some analytical deductions. Propagations of electromagnetic fields exhibit behaviors of water waves and sound waves. Formulas for field propagation speeds are derived for moving sources. For a source moving below c/2, electromagnetic fields exhibit a behavior of “pseudo inertia” which is between inertial and non-inertia. Speed c acts as a “speed barrier” for a source. A source may break the speed barrier with a limited amount of energy.

7. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/relativity.pdf">On Special Relativity</a><br>
Date: June 28, 2024<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Closed form analytical solutions to Maxwell’s equations for a moving Gaussian source reveal that Special Relativity produces a non-null result for Michelson-Morley experiment. To examine this unexpected discovery, Special Relativity is examined on its problem raising, its problem solving, and its explanations to the null result of Michelson-Morley experiment. Fundamental mistakes are discovered during the examination of its problem raising and its problem solving, leading to a discovery that Lorentz Covariance of Maxwell’s equations is not a physical reality. A mathematical proof is given for a conclusion that Special Relativity only produces non-null results for Michelson-Morley experiments.

8. Title: <a href="https://github.com/DavidGeUSA/MaxwellEquations/blob/main/doc/imagineryInertia.pdf">Imaginary Inertia of Special Relativity</a><br>
Date: July 26, 2024<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The concept of inertia used in Special Relativity is imaginary, not real. Parallel imaginary worlds are created by the principle of relativity for the imaginary inertia. Each reference frame is a center of the universe; observed from each reference frame all other reference frames are imaginary worlds. Observing the imaginary worlds, everything is inertial, including electromagnetic waves. Newton’s laws are not an approximation of the special theory of relativity; the two theories are discontinuous and parallel.
